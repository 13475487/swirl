### Intro to R - Content Outline ###

# Keep modules to less than 50 rows

# Module1 (assignment, atomic vectors, data types):

- R as a calculator

- motivation for programming

- creating variables with the assignment operator

- define data structures vs. data types

- most common data structure in R is the vector

- 2 flavors of vectors
	- atomic vectors: only one data type
	- lists: many data types
	
- 4 common types of atomic vectors (have user create one of each)
	- integer
	- double (numeric)
	- logical
	- character
	
# Module2 (coersion)

- motivation for dedicating entire module to coersion

- automatic vs. explicit coersion

- start with explicit examples

- have user guess automatic


# Module3 (matrices, lists, factors, data frames, missing values, attributes)

- matrices 
	- vectors with a dimension attribute
	- constructed column-wise
	- construct from vector by adding dim attribute
- lists
	- can contain multiple data types
	- very important in R
- factors
	- represent categorical data
	- think of as an integer vector where each integer has a label
- data frames
	- used to store tabular data
	- special type of list where every element is same length
	- typeof(df) # "list" vs. class(df) # "data.frame" -- see testing and coersion, data structures, hadley
	- heterogeneous
- missing values
	- NA and NaN
	- is.na() and is.nan()
- attributes/names
