Type `5 + 7` and press <enter>.",5 + 7,,,,,,text,"R simply prints the result of 13 by default. However, R is a programming language and often the reason we use a programming language as opposed to a calculator is to automate some process or avoid unneccessary repetition.",,,,,,,text,"In this case, we may want to use our result from above in a second calculation. Instead of retyping `5 + 7` every time we need it, we can just create a new variable that stores the result.",,,,,,,text,"The way you assign a value to a variable in R is by using the assignment operator, which is just a ""less than"" symbol followed by a dash. It looks like this: <-",,,,,,,text,Think of the assignment operator as an arrow. You are assigning the value on the right side of the arrow to the variable name on the left side of the arrow.,,,,,,,cmd_question,"To assign the result of `5 + 7` to a new variable called x, you type `x <- 5 + 7`. This can be read as ""x gets 5 plus 7."" Give it a try now.",x <- 5 + 7,,,,,,text,"You'll notice that R did not print the result of 13 this time. When you use the assignment operator, R assumes that you don't want to see the result immediately, but rather that you intend to use the result for something else later on.",,,,,,,cmd_question,"To view the contents of the variable x, just type `x` and press <enter>. Try it now.",x,,,,,,cmd_question,"Now, store the result of `x - 3` in a new variable called y.",y <- x - 3,,,,,,cmd_question,What is the value of y? Type `y` to find out.,,,,,,,text,"In the examples above, we know the numbers 3, 5, and 7 to be integers, but R sees them differently. Let's understand why.",,,,,,,text,"First, it's useful to distinguish data structures from data types. You can think of data structures as containers that hold data. Data types describe fundamental properties of that data.",,,,,,,text,The most basic data structure in R is a vector. Vectors are just collections of objects. Even single numbers are considered vectors of length 1.,,,,,,,text,"There are two different flavors of vectors in R: atomic vectors and lists. The data contained in an atomic vector must all be of the same type, whereas the data contained in a list can be of many different types.",,,,,,,text,"Let's take a closer look at atomic vectors, since they are so fundamental to everything else in R.",,,,,,,text,"The easiest way to create an atomic vector in R is with the `c()` function, which stands for concatenate or combine. If you want to create a vector containing the numbers 2, 3, and 4, you type `c(2, 3, 4)`.",,,,,,,cmd_question,"Create a vector containing the numbers 2, 4, 6, and 8 and store it in a variable called numVect (for ""numeric vector"").","numVect <- c(2, 4, 6, 8)",,,,,,text,"Since numVect is an atomic vector, all of its elements must be the same data type. In this case, we might expect that data type to be ""integer"". However, as we mentioned in the last example, R doesn't think this way.",,,,,,,text,"The 4 most common types of atomic vectors in R are ""character"", ""double"" (often called ""numeric""), ""integer"", and ""logical"" (TRUE/FALSE).",,,,,,,cmd_question,"If you want to know the type of data stored in an atomic vector, use the `typeof()` function. Try `typeof(numVect)` to see how R views our numbers 2, 4, 6, and 8.",typeof(numVect),,,,,,text,"So R considers 2, 4, 6, and 8 to be of type ""double"", which essentially means decimal or real numbers. This is R's default data type for numeric data. If you explicitly want an integer in R, you have to specify the `L` suffix.",,,,,,,cmd_question,"For example, let's create a new vector called intVect that contains the integers 3 and 7. To do this, type `intVect <- c(3L, 7L)`.","intVect <- c(3L, 7L)",,,,,,cmd_question,"Now, check that intVect is of type integer using the `typeof()` function.",typeof(intVect),,,,,,cmd_question,What do you think will happen if we create a new atomic vector called z1 that combines numVect and intVect? Give it a try.,"z1 <- c(numVect, intVect)",,,,,,cmd_question,Go ahead and print z1 to take a look at it.,z1,,,,,,cmd_question,Can you guess the type of z1? Use `typeof()` to see if you're right.,typeof(z1),,,,,,text,"So z1 is of type ""double"". This may or may not be what you expected, but there is a method to the madness and it's called ""coersion"".",,,,,,,text,"The elements of an atomic vector must all be of the same type. When you mix different types as we did above, R finds the type that is the ""lowest common denominator"". In other words, it must figure out a single type that is capable of expressing all elements of the new vector without losing too much information. Let's play with some more examples until you get the hang of this concept.",,,,,,,cmd_question,"In R, text data is stored as strings of characters enclosed in double quotes. Create a new variable called `charVect` that contains your name.","charVect <- ""Nick""",,,,,,cmd_question,Print the contents of `charVect`.,charVect,,,,,,cmd_question,Now check it's type.,typeof(charVect),,,,,,cmd_question,"Now combine z1 and charVect and assign the result to z2 with `z2 <- c(z1, charVect)`.","z2 <- c(z1, charVect)",,,,,,mult_question,What do you think will be the result of typeof(z2)?,"""character""","""character""; ""numeric""; ""integer""; ""raw""",,,,,cmd_question,View the contents of z2.,z2,,,,,,cmd_question,"All of the numbers in z2 have double quotes around them because R is now storing them as character strings. Confirm that z2 is of type ""character"".",typeof(z2),,,,,,text,"In this example, we attempted to mix a double (or numeric) vector with a character vector and we got a character vector. The reason for this is that we can easily represent numbers as character strings (e.g. the number 3 becomes the character ""3""), but there's no straightforward way to represent your name as number.",,,,,,,cmd_question,Let's play with a few more examples to get a better grasp of R's coersion rules. Create a logical vector called logVect that contains one TRUE and one FALSE. It's important that TRUE and FALSE are capitalized.,"logVect <- c(TRUE, FALSE)",,,,,,cmd_question,View the contents of logVect.,logVect,,,,,,cmd_question,Now let's mix our numeric and logical vectors and see what happens. Create a vector called z3 that combines numVect and logVect.,"z3 <- c(numVect, logVect)",,,,,,cmd_question,Type `z3` to take a look at the result.,z3,,,,,,text,"Notice that instead of TRUE and FALSE, the last two entries of z3 are 1 and 0. This is because R's numeric representations of TRUE and FALSE are 1 and 0, respectively. Since numVect is already an atomic vector of type double, it's easy for R to use the numeric represenation of logVect, so that the elements of z3 are all the same type.",,,,,,,mult_question,What will be the result of `typeof(z3)`?,"""double""","""double""; ""integer""; ""character""; ""logical""",,,,,cmd_question,Use `typeof()` to confirm that z3 is of type double.,typeof(z3),,,,,,cmd_question,Let's combine logVect and charVect to create a new atomic vector called z4. ,"z4 <- c(logVect, charVect)",,,,,,mult_question,What do you think will be the result of typeof(z4)?,"""character""","""double""; ""integer""; ""character""; ""logical""",,Is it easier to represent logical values (TRUE and FALSE) as character strings or to represent character strings as logical values?,,,cmd_question,"To see the entire ""chain of command"" that R uses for coersion, open the help file for the `c()` function by typing `?c`.",?c,,,,,,text,"The first sentence of the Details section outlines the hierarchy for coersion: NULL < raw < logical < integer < double < complex < character < list < expression. You may not recognize all of the elements of this hierachy yet, but you can at least see how R ranks the types we've discussed.",,,,,,,text,"The `?` function can be used to bring up the help file for any function and will become your best friend as you become a better programmer. Anytime you need it, just type ?function_name_here, and the help file for that function will pop right up.",,,,,,,
