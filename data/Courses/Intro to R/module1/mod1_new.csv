Type `5 + 7` and press <enter>.",5 + 7,,,,,,text,"R simply prints the result of 13 by default. However, R is a programming language and often the reason we use a programming language as opposed to a calculator is to automate some process or avoid unneccessary repetition.",,,,,,,text,"In this case, we may want to use our result from above in a second calculation. Instead of retyping `5 + 7` every time we need it, we can just create a new variable that stores the result.",,,,,,,text,"The way you assign a value to a variable in R is by using the assignment operator, which is just a ""less than"" symbol followed by a dash. It looks like this: <-",,,,,,,text,Think of the assignment operator as an arrow. You are assigning the value on the right side of the arrow to the variable name on the left side of the arrow.,,,,,,,cmd_question,"To assign the result of `5 + 7` to a new variable called x, you type `x <- 5 + 7`. This can be read as ""x gets 5 plus 7."" Give it a try now.",x <- 5 + 7,,,,,,text,"You'll notice that R did not print the result of 13 this time. When you use the assignment operator, R assumes that you don't want to see the result immediately, but rather that you intend to use the result for something else later on.",,,,,,,cmd_question,"To view the contents of the variable x, just type `x` and press <enter>. Try it now.",x,,,,,,cmd_question,"Now, store the result of `x - 3` in a new variable called y.",y <- x - 3,,,,,,cmd_question,What is the value of y? Type `y` to find out.,,,,,,,text,"In the examples above, we know the numbers 3, 5, and 7 to be integers, but R sees them differently. Let's understand why.",,,,,,,text,"First, it's useful to distinguish data structures from data types. You can think of data structures as containers that hold data. Data types describe fundamental properties of that data.",,,,,,,text,The most basic data structure in R is a vector. Vectors are just collections of objects. Even single numbers are considered vectors of length 1.,,,,,,,,"There are two different flavors of vectors in R: atomic vectors and lists. The data contained in an atomic vector must all be of the same type, whereas the data contained in a list can be of many different types.",,,,,,,text,"We will now take a closer look at atomic vectors, since they are so fundamental to everything else in R.",,,,,,,text,"The easiest way to create a vector in R is with the c() function, which stands for concatenate or combine. If you want to create a vector containing the numbers 2, 3, and 4, you would type c(2, 3, 4).",,,,,,,cmd_question,"Create a vector containing the numbers 2, 4, 6, and 8 and store it in a variable called z.","z <- c(2, 4, 6, 8)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,text,"R has 5 basic data types: character, numeric (real numbers), integer, complex, and logical (TRUE/FALSE).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Assignment operator, define data structures and data types, introduce vectors and different classes of atomic vectors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,text,"You'll notice R just printed your vector in the console, but that's not very helpful. Normally, we'd want to do something with this vector we've created. It would be tedious if we had to re-type it every time we needed it. Fortunately, we don't have to.",,,,,,,text,"If you want to assign a value to a variable in R, you use the assignment operator, which looks like this: <-",,,,,,,text,"For example, typing y <- 8 would create a variable called y that stores the value 8.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,text,"You can name a variable whatever you want as long as the name begins with a letter (a-z) and doesn't contain any weird symbols. For more information on variable naming conventions, Hadley Wickham's R style guide is a good starting point: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html",,,,,,,
